## Linear Regression

Linear regression is used to model the value of a dependent scale variable based on its linear relationship to one or more predictors. 


The linear regression model assumes that there is a linear, or "straight line," relationship between the dependent variable and each predictor. This relationship is described in the following formula.
**yi=b0+bxi1+...+ bP xip + ei**

where

**yi**  is the value of the ith case of the dependent scale variable

**p** is the number of predictors

**bj**  is the value of the jth coefficient, j=0,...,p

**xij** is the value of the ith case of the jth predictor

**ei** is the error in the observed value for the ith case

The model is linear because increasing the value of the jth predictor by 1 unit increases the value of the dependent by bj units. Note that b0
 is the intercept,the model-predicted value of the dependent variable when the value of every predictor is equal to 0.
